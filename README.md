### Public Commands

* **!stop** - Stop the currently running game.
* **!pause** - Pause the currently running game.
* **!resume** - Resume a paused game.
* **!join** - Join to the currently running game.
* **!j** - Alias for join command.
* **!quit** - Quit from the game.
* **!q** - alias for quit.
* **!cards** - Show the cards you have in your hand.
* **!cah # (#)** - Depending on the context this command will either play cards from your hand, or if you are the czar, will pick the winner at the end of a round
* **!points** - Show players' *awesome points* in the current game.
* **!list** - List players in the current game.
* **!players** - Alias for !list command
* **!status** - Show current status of the game. Output depends on the state of the game (e.g. when waiting for players to play, you can check who hasn't played yet)
* **!discard (#)** - Discard cards once per round, at the cost of one awesome point. You can either provide no arugments to get an entirely new hand, or you can provide indices to only discard those cards. You must have at least one awesome point to discard cards.

### Private Commands
* **!cah # (#)** - Play a card from your hand

All of these commands are case insensitive and are trimmed for whitespace so "!start" and "    !StaRt" will work the same
